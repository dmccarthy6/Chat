# Chat






The Chat Application utilizes the following:

Firebase
MessageKit
Tab Bar Controller


-When first logging in the user will need to enter an email address and password. This is saved in Firebase and the user will need to keep this userID/Password in order to log into the application. 

-After creating a userID/Password the user is added to the ‘All Users’ list. The user can now select that tab and choose a user to add to their friends list.

-Once the user sends a friend request to another person and they have accepted, they can then chat with that user using a chat view controller set up using MessageKit.
